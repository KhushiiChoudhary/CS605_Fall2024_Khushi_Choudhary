Binary Search Tree for Contact Management

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) for managing a list of contacts where each contact consists of a name and a phone number. You can insert, search, and delete contacts using their names as the key. The tree is printed in sorted order using in-order traversal after every operation.

Features
- Insert a Contact: Adds a new contact to the tree or updates the phone number if the contact already exists.
- Search for a Contact: Retrieves the phone number associated with a given name.
- Delete a Contact: Removes a contact from the tree.
- In-Order Traversal: Displays the list of contacts in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Tree Operations
- Insert: Adds a node with a name (key) and phone number (value) to the tree.
- Search: Looks for a contact in the tree by name and returns their phone number.
- Delete: Deletes a contact from the tree by name, adjusting the tree structure accordingly.
- In-Order Traversal: Prints the tree in sorted order of names.
