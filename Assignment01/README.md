Simple Calculator

Overview : This project is a basic console-based calculator that performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows users to enter two numbers, choose an operation, view the result, and optionally continue performing calculations.

## How to Use
1. Clone or Download the Project:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub using:
     git clone <https://github.com/KhushiiChoudhary/CS605_Fall2024_Khushi_Choudhary/edit/main/Assignment01>
   - Or, download the project as a zip file from the repository.

2. Run the Program:
   - Open the Python script `calculator.py` in any Python environment (IDE or terminal).
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Steps to Perform a Calculation:
   - Run the script in your Python environment.
   - You will be prompted to choose an operation:

     1 - Add
     2 - Subtract
     3 - Multiply
     4 - Divide
     5 - Exit
     6 - GoodBye!
     
   - Enter the corresponding number for the operation you want to perform.
   - Input the first number and the second number when prompted.
   - The calculator will display the result of the operation.
   
4. Handle Invalid Inputs:
   - If a non-numeric value is entered for the operation or numbers, an error message will appear, and you will be asked to re-enter a valid value.
   - Division by zero is not allowed. If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will notify you and prompt you to enter a different operation.

5. Repeat or Exit:
   - After each calculation, the program will ask if you want to perform another operation.
   - Type `yes` to continue, or any other input to exit the calculator.

Example Run

1 - Add
2 - Subtract
3 - Multiply
4 - Divide
5 - Exit
6 - GoodBye!

Choose an operation: 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
The result of 5 + 3 is: 8
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no
Goodbye!

Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Notes
Make sure to follow the proper syntax when entering values. The program handles invalid inputs and will prompt you to re-enter if a mistake is made.

This README provides a clear explanation of how to use the calculator, step-by-step instructions for running it, and what users should expect during execution.
